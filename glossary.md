# Glossary of Network Terms

### Adjacency Matrix

A common data structure used to represent a network.

The rows and columns are nodes, and the cells represent their relatedness.

More formally it is an $n \times n$ matrix $g$ where a node is $g_{ij}$ with a value of $0$ if unrelated and $\gt 0$ when related in some way.

##### Example

For the network with nodes $N = ({\text{Node-A},\space\text{Node-B},\space\text{Node-C}})$ and this adjacency matrix:

$$
g =\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

gives this network:

### Bridge

A node in a network such that if removed increases the number of components in the network.

A good, though not the only, example in the following network would be $\text{Node-Z}$:

when removed results in:

## Centrality

*Centrality* is a measure of a node's "importance" in the network.

Common measures are:

- Degree
- Closeness
- Betweenness
- Katz or Decay

### Betweenness (Centrality)

*Betweenness* identifies nodes which "control" flow.

So, a node $k$ stands in-*between* nodes $i$ and $j$ if is part of a path between the two.

The formal definition is:

$$
Centrality_{k}^{B} = \sum_{i,j \not = k} \frac {\sigma_{k}(i,j)} {\sigma(i,j)}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the number of shortest paths between 2 nodes, here $i$ and $j$ and $\sigma_{k}$ is the number of shortest paths between $i$ and $j$ in which $k$ participates.

### Closeness (Centrality)

*Closeness* identifies nodes "nearer" -- lower path length -- to all other nodes.

$$
Centrality^{C}_{i} = \frac {n-1} {\sum_{i,j} l(i, j)}
$$

### Decay Centrality

A measure of a node's important where distance to another node attenuates. It is similar to closeness but the "weight" of edges is $0 \lt \delta \lt 1$.

$$
Centrality_{i}^{\delta} = \frac {\delta(n-1)} {\sum \delta^{l_{i}}}
$$

### Degree Centrality

Degree centrality measures the node's importance on the number of edges it has.

$$Cent^{D}_{i} = \frac {d(i)} {n-1} $$

### Examples

##### Kite Network

A *kite* network is a very basic network useful to see some basic network properties. Here is such a network annotated with centrality measures.

##### Florentine Families

The Florentine Families network is a small and often used dataset to explore influence. The Medici family was quite powerful during this time through a series of strategic marriages.

Exploring this dataset via centrality measures reveals this and other interesting network features/families.

#### Weakly Connected Component

In an undirected network, a set of nodes such that a path exists between all pairs of nodes.

$$
S_{i,j} \subset g = \forall_{i,j} \space \exists \space p_{i,j}
$$

#### Strongly Connected Component

### Density

A maximally dense network would be a complete network, thus density is:

$$
\frac {Avg(d)} {n-1}
$$

### Diameter

The length of the largest distance between 2 nodes $i$ and $j$. Also, may be defined as the maximum eccentricity for all dyads in a graph $g$.

See: *Eccentricity*, *Radius*

### Digraph

See *Network*, specifically *Directed*.

### Distance

Aliases: *Length*

See: *Eccentricity*, *Radius*

### Forest

A set of tree components.

### Geodesic

A shortest path between 2 nodes.

See *Path*, *Walk*, *Cycle*.

#### Mean Geodesic

The mean geodesic $\bar{l}$ is the average path length. There are 2 ways to think of this:

*From a random node* $i$:

- And another random node $j$, what is the expected number of edges?
- If the nodes are say webpages, how many clicks are expected to another random page?

Formally:

$$
\bar{l} = \frac {\sum_{i \not = j} d(i,j)} {n(n-1)}
$$

> Divide the sum of the distances between all dyads by the number of possible dyads.

### Node

A node is one of the 2 primitive elements of a network.

Nodes are usually "things" or nouns such as:

- People - when part of a social network; other examples include:
  - Plants and animals in an ecosystem
  - Social media
- Computers - when part of a physical network; other examples include:
  - Cities, ports, stores, etc - as part of a transportation, distribution, supply chain
- Webpages - when part of an informational network; other examples include:
  - Academic papers, movie actors, 

Nodes are connected or related to each other via edges.
