Info for the 101 presentation includes:

<ul>
  <li>What is <i>network analysis</i> / <i>network science</i>?</li>
  <li>What is a <i>network</i>?</li>
  <li>What are the basic analytic measures on networks?</li>
  <li>What are <i>small-world</i> networks?</li>
</ul>

<p>The set of basic analytic statistical measures on *networks* are measures on the nodes of a network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Degree: Ordering nodes' importance on the number of its neighbors</li>
  <li>Closeness: Ordering nodes' importance on how near they are to all other nodes</li>
  <li>Betweenness: Ordering nodes' importance on their frequency between all nodes</li>
  <li>Decay: Ordering nodes' importance based on distance; the generalization of degree and closeness</li>
</ul>
