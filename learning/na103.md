## Agenda

- **Review:**  
  - Recap of node centrality measures from NA101 (degree, betweenness, closeness).
  - Recap of whole graph measures from NA102 (density and clustering coefficient).

- **Lab Exercises:**
  1. Hands-on with synthetic networks using Python NetworkX.
  2. Analyzing node centrality in a sample network.
  3. Computing density and average clustering coefficient.
  4. Real-world application using Zachary's Karate Club dataset.

- **Discussion & Q&A**

## What You Will Need

- A computer with Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended).
- Required libraries:
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - (Optional) Pandas for data manipulation.
  
Before starting, ensure you have installed the above packages.

## Lab Exercise 1: Exploring Centrality Measures

### Objective
Practice computing and interpreting node centrality measures on a synthetic network.

### Instructions:
1. **Create a simple graph** with nodes A, B, C, D, E and add various edges.
2. Compute these centrality measures using Python NetworkX:
   - Degree Centrality  
     $$\text{Degree Centrality}(v) = \frac{\deg(v)}{|N|-1}$$
   - Betweenness Centrality  
   - Closeness Centrality  
3. **Questions to Consider:**
   - Which node is most central?
   - How do the different measures compare?

### Sample Code:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple graph
G = nx.Graph()
nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
edges = [('A','B'), ('A','C'), ('B','C'),
         ('B','D'), ('C','D'), ('D','E')]
G.add_nodes_from(nodes)
G.add_edges_from(edges)

# Compute centrality measures
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
betweenness_centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(G)

print("Degree Centrality:", degree_centrality)
print("Betweenness Centrality:", betweenness_centrality)
print("Closeness Centrality:", closeness_centrality)

# Visualize the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', edge_color='gray')
plt.show()
```

## Lab Exercise 2: Whole Graph Measures

### Objective
Learn to calculate and interpret overall network metrics such as Density and Clustering Coefficient.

### Instructions:
1. Using your synthetic graph from Exercise 1 (or a new one), compute:
   - **Network Density:**  
     $$\text{Density} = \frac{|E|}{\frac{|N|(|N|-1)}{2}}$$
   - **Average Clustering Coefficient:**
2. Reflect on how these measures provide insight into the network’s connectivity and local structure.

### Sample Code:

```python
# Compute Density
density = nx.density(G)
print("Network Density:", density)

# Compute Clustering Coefficient for each node
clust_coeff = nx.clustering(G)
avg_clustering = sum(clust_coeff.values()) / len(clust_coeff)
print("Average Clustering Coefficient:", avg_clustering)
```

## Lab Exercise 3: Real-World Application – Zachary's Karate Club

### Objective
Apply your skills to analyze a real-world network dataset.

### Instructions:
1. **Load the Dataset:**  
   Use NetworkX’s built-in function to load the "Zachary Karate Club" data.
   ```python
   G_karate = nx.karate_club_graph()
   ```
2. **Centrality Analysis:**
   - Compute degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality for the network.
   - Visualize the graph with nodes colored by their centrality scores.
3. **Whole Graph Measures:**  
   - Calculate density and average clustering coefficient.
4. **Discussion Questions:**
   - Which member of the club is most central?
   - How do these measures help explain the social dynamics within the club?

### Sample Code:

```python
# Load Karate Club Data
G_karate = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Compute Centrality Measures for Karate Club
degree_centrality_k = nx.degree_centrality(G_karate)
betweenness_centrality_k = nx.betweenness_centrality(G_karate)
closeness_centrality_k = nx.closeness_centrality(G_karate)

print("Karate Club Degree Centrality:", degree_centrality_k)
print("Karate Club Betweenness Centrality:", betweenness_centrality_k)
print("Karate Club Closeness Centrality:", closeness_centrality_k)

# Compute Density and Average Clustering Coefficient
density_k = nx.density(G_karate)
avg_clustering_k = nx.average_clustering(G_karate)
print("Karate Club Density:", density_k)
print("Karate Club Average Clustering Coefficient:", avg_clustering_k)

# Visualize the Karate Club Graph with a consistent layout
pos = nx.spring_layout(G_karate, seed=42)
nx.draw(G_karate, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightgreen', edge_color='gray')
plt.show()
```
