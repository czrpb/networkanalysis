# Network Analysis 102: Synthetic Measures

Quentin Crain

---

## Agenda

![bg right:33%](images/net-bg-2.png)

- Objectives
- Synthetic
  - Paths
  - Density
  - Connectedness
    - Connected & Components
    - Triads / Clustering Coefficient
  - Community
    - Lab: Zachary's Karate Club

---

## Objectives

- Selfish: I love network science!
  - Practicing the Feynman method
- Educative: Want to spread the knowledge!
  - I believe there are some *Network Science* measures that everyone ought to know like we know mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.
- Preferential: What sorts of presentations do people want?
  - "Academic" vs "Project"
  - "Informational" vs "Interactive"
  - "Theoretical" vs "Practical"
  - "Educative" vs "Inspirational"
- Added a **Lab!!!**

## Basic Network Analysis: Synthetic

The basic synthetic, or wholistic, statistics on networks are measures meant to give information to the overall structure of the network.

---

### Path / Geodesic / Diameter

<img alt="A path, a geodesic, and a diameter" src="images/net-path-types.png" /><img alt="Previous with measures" src="images/net-distance-deneccdia.png" />

|Path|Geodesic|Diameter|
|---|---|---|
|The set of nodes and their edges joining 2 nodes|A shortest path between 2 nodes|The longest shortest path in a network|
|start->a->b->c->end<br/>4|start->1->2->end<br/>3|A->B->1->M->c->D->E<br/>6|

---

### Density

*Density* is a measure of how connected a network is.

||Number of Edges|Number of Nodes|$Density$|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
||$E$|$N$|$\frac {E} {\frac {N(N-1)} {2} }$|
|<img alt="Next Highest Density" src="images/net-ego-abcd-ab-density.png" height="128"/>|$5$|$5$|$\frac {5} {\frac {5*4} {2}} \to \frac {10} {20} \to 0.5$|
|<img alt="Next Highest Density" src="images/net-ego-abcd-ab-cd-density.png" height="128"/>|$6$|$5$|$\frac {6} {\frac {5*4} {2}} \to \frac {12} {20} \to 0.6$|
|<img alt="Highest Density" src="images/net-ego-abcd-connected-density.png" height="128"/>|$8$|$5$|$\frac {8} {\frac {5*4} {2}} \to \frac {16} {20} \to 0.8$|

---

### Connectedness

* **Connected**: A property on a set of nodes such that there exists a path between all dyads
  * **Component**/**Cluster**: A maximal subset of nodes in a network that are *connected*
* **Complete**: A property on a set of nodes such that all nodes are *connected*
  * **Clique**: A subset of nodes in a network that are *complete*
* <br/><img src="images/net-connectedness.png">

---

### Triads (Triangles)

A *triad* is a *complete* set of 3 nodes.

![Triangle](images/net-clique-abc.png)

*Triangles* are used in the measure called *clustering coefficient*.

---

### Clustering Coefficient

*Clustering coefficient* is the ratio of connected neighboring dyads;
or ratio of participation in possible triangles.

|<img alt="Clustering coefficient of a kite" src="images/net-ego-abc-bc-clustering.png" width="160" />|$\tau_{i}$|$k_{i}$|$CC_{i} = \frac {\tau_{i}} {\frac {k_{i}(k_{i}-1)} {2}}$|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
||number of triangles $i$ participates in|number of neighbors for $i$|ratio of $i$ participating to total possible participation|
|$\text {ego}$|$1$|$3$|$\frac {1} {3}$|
|$\text {b, c}$|$1$|$1$|$\frac {1} {1} \to 1$|
|Triple(ego,b,c)|||$\frac {\frac {7} {3}} {3} = 0.777$|
|$\bar{CC}$|||$\frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} CC_{i}} {n} = \frac {\frac {7} {3}} {4} = 0.583$|

---

## Community

*Communities* as (sub)sets of nodes in a network which have a high(er) clustering coefficient or high(er) cohesion.

---

### Weak & Strong Community

##### Strong

Each node in the community has more connection within the community than without

##### Weak

The average of the internal connectivity of the community is greater than its external connectivity

---

### Hierarchical Clustering

| | Agglomerative | Divisive |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Description | Find communities by putting nodes together | Find communities by separating nodes from each other |
| Algorithm | Ravasz | Girvan-Newman |

---

### Example: 4 Communities

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4"><img alt="4 Communities" src="images/net-community-ABCD-starcliquecomplete.png" /></td>
    <th>Agglomerative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td data-marpit-fragment="1">Aggregate around nodes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Divisive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td data-marpit-fragment="2">Remove edges ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'D'), ('B', 'C'), ('D', 'C')</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Lab!!!

### Zachary's Karate Club

The social network captured by Zachary is a fundamental network used to learn about community algorithms. In this way it is similar to learning about neural nets via the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
