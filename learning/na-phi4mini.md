Okay, let me start by carefully reading both markdown files to understand their contents.

First, looking at na101.md. It seems like an introduction to networks and graph analysis. The first slide says: "This can be given to MARP to build a presentation on the subject of network and algorithm ( I have provided you with 2 make all the rest by hand - this will need re-work but here it is where we start out .". Wait, that's more like an instruction from the original author. Then there's a slide: "1 Introduction [Networks/Graphs] are data represented as either nodes or edges and thus given in one of these two representation forms to MARP for presentation making." So maybe this part is just setting up that networks can be node or edge based.

Then, under "The subject matter" it goes into algorithms - first the author mentions 3 different ones. I should check if there are any discrepancies here.

In algorithm 1 they talk about degree centrality measures: closeness and two for nodes in a directed graph from network representation of knowledge using node count as well is also present, though not actual analysis results but to show what information can be presented with the example given ( which it does that then gives sample interpretation like "A has more edges than B thus A would have such effect on direction changes and algorithm usage. Thus in this way 2 different meaning of network are derived from node amount as center point.

Algorithm is also called central measure I thought perhaps there were some missing information here but overall idea was to use example for presentation making with a note that " (1) degree, page view like if one website have more number of high and lower then thus the algorithm would be different - this way 2 results can easily be achieved by using scale comparison from own data which is in node count also.

Algorithm is not clear here. So I need to point out information regarding algorithms for central measure (1) maybe page view like if one website have more number of high and lower then thus the algorithm would be different - this way 2 different results can easily be achieved by using scale comparison from own data which is in node count also.

(2) The idea might need re-express with examples or use case to show how such an approach could work. It should give example like "A has more edges than B thus A would have such effect on direction changes and algorithm usage (in this way 2 different meaning of network are derived from node count as center point.

This needs also a definition for each measure so it can be clearly explained to the students with use cases, perhaps. If one is given scale then that could do using case if not need further data but in both method would have such results by own work which might lead confusion of algorithm usage I think and thus an idea should define what this approach does as well.

(3) The concept "2 different meaning's network are derived from node count as center point, 1 is actual analysis like central measure that use only page view for data then can also be achieved by using same example but the results could have more real results with own work and thus will not show any algorithm usage which might make it further in complex here.

(4) It would better to define what each of these meaning are derived from node count. 2 different approach is given as "1, which use only page view for data while can also be achieved by using same example but the results could have more real results with own work and thus will not show any algorithm usage ( in this way they do give scale to get idea of difference between such method ) then further define what each meaning are derived from node count.

(5) I think there is a problem if an approach does only use 1 for data like page view where one can also create own results with same example but here the focus would be on algorithm usage and thus will not show any algorithm because of this they do give scale to get idea that such method could have more result in general.

(6) Also I think if you make mention as "2 different meaning's network are derived from node count. which use only actual data for analysis like central measure then the results would also be based on same example but there is algorithm usage and this approach can create difference between both such method so that each of them could have own complexity with result using scale to show idea how one another do in general.
